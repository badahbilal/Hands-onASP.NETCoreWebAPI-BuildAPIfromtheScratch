In this lecture, the focus is on HTTP status codes, which are unique codes returned by a server in response to HTTP requests. These codes provide information about the outcome of the request, whether it was successful or encountered an error. Here's a summary of the key points:

Importance of Status Codes: Status codes are crucial in API design and implementation as they communicate the result of an HTTP request to clients. Selecting the appropriate status code is essential for conveying the correct information.

Categories of Status Codes: HTTP status codes are grouped into different classes based on the type of response they represent.

1XX (Informational): These codes provide informational responses and are not typically used for normal HTTP interactions.

2XX (Success): This class indicates successful request handling. For example, 200 OK signifies a successful request, while 201 Created is used when a new resource is created on the server. The status code 204 No Content indicates success with no response body.

3XX (Redirection): These codes are used for redirection scenarios, indicating that further action is required by the client to fulfill the request.

4XX (Client Errors): Codes in this class represent errors on the client side. For example, 400 Bad Request indicates that the client sent an improperly formatted or invalid request. 401 Unauthorized signals that the client lacks proper authorization. 403 Forbidden indicates that the client is not allowed access, and the famous 404 Not Found signifies that the requested URL does not exist on the server. Additionally, 405 Method Not Allowed specifies that the requested HTTP method is not permitted for the client.

5XX (Server Errors): Status codes in this class indicate issues on the server side. For instance, 500 Internal Server Error is a common code returned when an unspecified error occurs on the server. The 501 Not Implemented code signifies that the requested functionality is not implemented on the server.

In summary, HTTP status codes play a crucial role in conveying the outcome of HTTP requests. They are categorized into classes based on their purpose, and understanding these codes is vital for designing and implementing effective web APIs. The lecture emphasizes that 2XX codes denote success, 4XX codes indicate client-side errors, and 5XX codes represent server-side errors.
