In this section of the lecture, the instructor guides through the process of creating a new Web API project using Visual Studio Code. Here's a summarized step-by-step overview:

Selecting a Folder: Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the file menu. Choose "Open Folder" to select the folder where you want to create your project. The instructor suggests using a folder named "CMS web API" under the "Documents" directory as an example.

Creating a Web API Project: Within the selected folder, create a new project folder with the name "CMS.webAPI."

Using Terminal: Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code. The instructor mentions that they will use the dotnet command to create the Web API project.

Project Creation: To create a new Web API project, use the following command: dotnet new webAPI. This command sets up the basic structure for a Web API project.

Exploring the Created Project: After project creation, expand the "CMS web API" project folder to view the default files generated by the dotnet command. Key files mentioned include:

Startup.cs: Contains methods for configuring services and the application. It's used to configure basic settings for the Web API.
Program.cs: Contains code to start the application and create a host.
WeatherForecast model and WeatherForecastController: These are created as demo components to showcase API usage.
Running the Application: To run the Web API application, use the dotnet run command in the terminal. The application starts listening on Port 5000.

Testing with Postman: The instructor suggests using Postman to test the API. They provide instructions for creating a new collection and a request. In this example, a request named "weather forecast" with the HTTP GET method is created to test the default "WeatherForecast" controller. The request is sent, and sample data is received as a response.

The lecture concludes by mentioning that the Web API project can be extended with custom business logic. Future lectures will explore different aspects of Web API development.
